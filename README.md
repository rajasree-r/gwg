**Grow With Google Scholarship ~ Udacity**

Being a recipient of the Grow with Google Android Developer scholarship, I was doing many projects as a part of the scholarship. Here I have committed all the codes I wrote as a part of various projects during the course, like a Coffee ordering app, a quiz trivia app and a score-keeper app. My slack channel for this set of codes is, **#grow_with_google** on my slack work space [**women coders**](https://womencodersworkspace.slack.com).
